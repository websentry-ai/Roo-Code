![3.45.0 Release - Smart Code Folding](/releases/3.45.0-release.png)

- Smart Code Folding: Context condensation now intelligently preserves a lightweight map of files you worked on—function signatures, class declarations, and type definitions—so Roo can continue referencing them accurately after condensing. Files are prioritized by most recent access, with a ~50k character budget ensuring your latest work is always preserved. (Idea by @shariqriazz, PR #10942 by @hannesrudolph)
